# Simple-Weather-Station-using-Arduino-uno
We use the Arduino to develop a weather monitoring system based on temperature and humidity variables obtained from a DHT11 sensor. The system, when tested, was able to report if weather is Hot, Normal, or Cold based on the exact temperature and relative humidity within a 20meter area.
